TODO:
Fix multiple react renders





NODES:
/*
title: string
pos: [x,y]
size: [x,y]

input|output: every connection
+  { name:string, type:string, pos: [x,y]=Optional, direction: "input"|"output", links: Array });

general properties:
+ clip_area: if you render outside the node, it will be clipped
+ unsafe_execution: not allowed for safe execution
+ skip_repeated_outputs: when adding new outputs, it wont show if there is one already connected
+ resizable: if set to false it wont be resizable with the mouse
+ horizontal: slots are distributed horizontally
+ widgets_up: widgets start from the top of the node

flags object:
+ collapsed: if it is collapsed

supported callbacks:
+ onAdded: when added to graph (warning: this is called BEFORE the node is configured when loading)
+ onRemoved: when removed from graph
+ onStart:	when the graph starts playing
+ onStop:	when the graph stops playing
+ onDrawForeground: render the inside widgets inside the node
+ onDrawBackground: render the background area inside the node (only in edit mode)
+ onMouseDown
+ onMouseMove
+ onMouseUp
+ onMouseEnter
+ onMouseLeave
+ onExecute: execute the node
+ onPropertyChanged: when a property is changed in the panel (return true to skip default behaviour)
+ onGetInputs: returns an array of possible inputs
+ onGetOutputs: returns an array of possible outputs
+ onBounding: in case this node has a bigger bounding than the node itself (the callback receives the bounding as [x,y,w,h])
+ onDblClick: double clicked in the node
+ onInputDblClick: input slot double clicked (can be used to automatically create a node connected)
+ onOutputDblClick: output slot double clicked (can be used to automatically create a node connected)
+ onConfigure: called after the node has been configured
+ onSerialize: to add extra info when serializing (the callback receives the object that should be filled with the data)
+ onSelected
+ onDeselected
+ onDropItem : DOM item dropped over the node
+ onDropFile : file dropped over the node
+ onConnectInput : if returns false the incoming connection will be canceled
+ onConnectionsChange : a connection changed (new one or removed) (LiteGraph.INPUT or LiteGraph.OUTPUT, slot, true if connected, link_info, input_info )
+ onAction: action slot triggered
+ getExtraMenuOptions: to add option to context menu
