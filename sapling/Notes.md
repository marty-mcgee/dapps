* Leaf droop based on gravity
* Flat leaves (i.e. independent of branch direction)

  * Basic problem with sprited twigs is that we can't change twig length per branch.
  * Whether a branch has leaves
  * Or perhaps a 'minLevel' for leaves
* Color hex edit
* Help pane?
  * Descriptions for properties?
* Uniform leaf sizes for non-monos
